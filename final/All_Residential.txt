Each house is in the Metro Vancouver area or on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada.
All houses are powered by the provincial power utility BC Hydro (https://www.bchydro.com/).
Power generation is nearly 100% hydro-electric with large dams.
The majority of houses are heated by natural gas provided by FortisBC (https://www.fortisbc.com/).
Hourly energy data is downloaded directly by the customer from the BC Hydro website.
Customers login to there account, download the data, and donated it to this dataset for research.
Donated data is anonymized to protect the privacy of the donors.

First Reading:
    The first reading date in the house's data file.

Last Reading:
    The last reading date in the house's data file.
    At the end of each year, some house files will be updated with new data.

Cover (data coverage):
    The percent of non-missing readings. A value of 1.000 is 100%.

House Types:
    character   - multi-level houses build before 1940
    bungalow    - single-level (w/ basement) houses built in the 1940s and 1950s

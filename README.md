# HUE: The Hourly Usage of Energy Dataset for Buildings in British Columbia

These are the scripts that where used to capture data and convert that raw data to the final dataset files. The **HUE dataset** consists of long-term hourly energy data from houses and other types of building that are customers of power utility BC Hydro. Data was kindly donated to us by various customers. Data was anonymized to protect donor identities.
